										<h3>Development Team Project: Project Report</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Posing as a team of Data Scientists, answer a business question formulated using
												<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data" target="_blank"> <u>this Airbnb dataset</u> </a>
												that can be solved with data analytics. Create a report which can easily be interpreted by the executive board members of Airbnb.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
													<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>After a few discussions with the team I was assigned, we developed the following business question to answer using the Airbnb dataset: <i>"How do various factors
												influence the likelihood of a listing being booked?"</i>. To answer this, the team first focused on exploratory data analysis, which can be seen in detail in
												<a href="Assignments/Group project notebook.ipynb" target="_blank"> "this notebook"</a>.
												The data analysis and visualizations that I focused on were the the K Means algorithm. I have a love for data that is simple and beautiful, 
												and I think that the diagrams obtained from the K means algorithm were the definition of easy to understand and easy on the eyes. 
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/K means diagram.png" alt="" /></span>
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/K means boxplots.png" alt="" /></span>
												After finishing the data analysis, the team came together to create
												<a href="Assignments/Group Project Machine Learning.pdf" target="_blank"> "this analytical report"</a>.
											</p>
											<h4><i>Reflections on Project Report</i></h4>
											<p>
												When it comes to the learning outcomes, I believe I fully achieved the first. Our team struggled a bit with figuring out what environment would be best to code with, but Google Colab 
												ended up being our solution. After that, the coding itself was smooth sailing, with little to no difficulties. However, the second learning outcome is what I need to reflect upon most. 
												<br>
												<br>
												When creating this report, I noticed that our team struggled to stay on schedule. We only came together approximately 2 weeks before the deadline of the assignment, 
												and that was because one of our group members took the initiative to be the leader and organize some ideas. I quickly worked with this individual to come up with a few 
												business questions, however after this initial work was done, it took a long time before any other movements were made. A few of us had some real life obligations that could not be 
												avoided. So, as a group we failed to correctly organize our time and maintain a good schedule to keep everyone included and able to contribute. We rushed our work a bit towards the end, which I feel 
												can be felt in the end quality of the report. Next time I work in a team, I will do better to try and establish a schedule that works for everyone, despite the fact that 
												I am uncomfortable in a leadership role and struggle to take initiative. This is something that I need to work on, as I realized while working on this assignment.

										<h3>Development Individual Project: Presentation</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Create a neural network that can recognize images. Give an oral presentation to showcase your work.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcome</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>This assignment involved developing a Neural Network using the CIFAR-10 image dataset for object recognition. After coding a convolutional 
												neural network (CNN), which can be found in
												<a href="Assignments/CNN Final.ipynb" target="_blank"> "this notebook"</a>, I was inspired by seminar 7 of this module to try my hand at a residual neural 
												network (ResNet). The notebook for that attempt can be found
												<a href="Assignments/ResNet failure.ipynb" target="_blank"> "here"</a>. Unfortunately, while ResNet algorithms are superior, I was unable to make it as accurate 
												as I wanted it to be, so I ended up using the CNN as the neural network for the presentation. My presentation can be found
												<a href="Assignments/Oral Presentation.pptx target="_blank"> "here"</a>. The transcript can be found
												<a href="Assignments/Transcript.pdf target="_blank"> "here"</a>. Below are some of the visualizations I created for the presentation.

											<h4><i>Reflections on Project Report</i></h4>
											<p>
												For this assignment, the sole learning outcome was to be able to 
												"apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved". 
												I believe that I achieved this learning outcome, especially when it comes to critically appriasing machine learning techniques. Within my presentation, 
												I discuss in detail the benefits of using certain techniques, why ResNet is superior to CNN, the trade off of a larger batchsize (more power, less accuracy), and more.

												After finishing the exploratory data analysis tutorial in Google Colab, the task directed students to undergo similar data analysis with the Autompg dataset.
												<a href="Assignments/EDA_tutorial.ipynb target="_blank"> "Here"</a> is the notebook showing the exploratory data analysis that took place.

										<h3>Jaccard Coefficient Calculations</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Calculate the Jaccard Coefficient Calculations in a given table.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												I was given the following table and told to calculate the Jaccard Coefficient for the following pairs: "Jack and Mary", "Jack and Jim", and "Mary and Jim". 
												To properly calculate the Jaccard coefficient, first I discarded the gender column and transformed the rest of the table into binaries. 
												<div class="row">
													<div class="column">
													  <img src="images/Jaccard 1.png" style="width:100%">
													</div>
													<div class="column">
													  <img src="images/Jaccard 2.png" style="width:100%">
													</div>
												</div> 
												After converting the table into binaries, we calculate the intersection between each pair. For example, Jack and Mary both have Fever and Test, so they have an intersection of 2. 
												Jack and Jim have an intersection of 2 as well, and so does Mary and Jim. 
												We also need to find out the union between the pairs. According to the binary table, Jack and Mary have 5 total attributes. Jack and Jim have 4, and Mary and Jim have 6. 
												The Jaccard coefficients are as follows: Jack and Mary = 2/5 = 0.4, Jack and Jim = 2/4 = 0.5, Mary and Jim = 2/6 ≈ 0.333.
