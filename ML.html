										<h3>Development Team Project: Project Report</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Posing as a team of Data Scientists, answer a business question formulated using
												<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data" target="_blank"> <u>this Airbnb dataset</u> </a>
												that can be solved with data analytics. Create a report which can easily be interpreted by the executive board members of Airbnb.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
													<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>After a few discussions with the team I was assigned, we developed the following business question to answer using the Airbnb dataset: <i>"How do various factors
												influence the likelihood of a listing being booked?"</i>. To answer this, the team first focused on exploratory data analysis, which can be seen in detail in
												<a href="Assignments/Group project notebook.ipynb" target="_blank"> "this notebook"</a>.
												The data analysis and visualizations that I focused on were the the K Means algorithm. I have a love for data that is simple and beautiful, 
												and I think that the diagrams obtained from the K means algorithm were the definition of easy to understand and easy on the eyes. 
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/K means diagram.png" alt="" /></span>
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/K means boxplots.png" alt="" /></span>
												After finishing the data analysis, the team came together to create
												<a href="Assignments/Group Project Machine Learning.pdf" target="_blank"> "this analytical report"</a>.
											</p>
											<h4><i>Reflections on Project Report</i></h4>
											<p>
												When it comes to the learning outcomes, I believe I fully achieved the first. Our team struggled a bit with figuring out what environment would be best to code with, but Google Colab 
												ended up being our solution. After that, the coding itself was smooth sailing, with little to no difficulties. However, the second learning outcome is what I need to reflect upon most. 
												<br>
												<br>
												When creating this report, I noticed that our team struggled to stay on schedule. We only came together approximately 2 weeks before the deadline of the assignment, 
												and that was because one of our group members took the initiative to be the leader and organize some ideas. I quickly worked with this individual to come up with a few 
												business questions, however after this initial work was done, it took a long time before any other movements were made. A few of us had some real life obligations that could not be 
												avoided. So, as a group we failed to correctly organize our time and maintain a good schedule to keep everyone included and able to contribute. We rushed our work a bit towards the end, which I feel 
												can be felt in the end quality of the report. Next time I work in a team, I will do better to try and establish a schedule that works for everyone, despite the fact that 
												I am uncomfortable in a leadership role and struggle to take initiative. This is something that I need to work on, as I realized while working on this assignment.

										<h3>Development Individual Project: Presentation</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Create a neural network that can recognize images. Give an oral presentation to showcase your work.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcome</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>This assignment involved developing a Neural Network using the CIFAR-10 image dataset for object recognition. After coding a convolutional 
												neural network (CNN), which can be found in
												<a href="Assignments/CNN Final.ipynb" target="_blank"> "this notebook"</a>, I was inspired by seminar 7 of this module to try my hand at a residual neural 
												network (ResNet). The notebook for that attempt can be found
												<a href="Assignments/ResNet failure.ipynb" target="_blank"> "here"</a>. Unfortunately, while ResNet algorithms are superior, I was unable to make it as accurate 
												as I wanted it to be, so I ended up using the CNN as the neural network for the presentation. My presentation can be found
												<a href="Assignments/Oral Presentation.pptx" target ="_blank"> "here"</a>. The transcript can be found
												<a href="Assignments/Transcript.pdf" target ="_blank"> "here"</a>. Below are some of the visualizations I created for the presentation.

											<h4><i>Reflections on Project Report</i></h4>
											<p>
												For this assignment, the sole learning outcome was to be able to 
												"apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved". 
												I believe that I achieved this learning outcome, especially when it comes to critically appriasing machine learning techniques. Within my presentation, 
												I discuss in detail the benefits of using certain techniques, why ResNet is superior to CNN, the trade off of a larger batchsize (more power, less accuracy), and more.

											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>

										<h3>Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Undertake a correlation and a regression task using Scikit-Learn.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>

											</blockquote>
											<p>
												<u>Task A: Correlation</u>
												<br> 
												<br> 
												This task asked students to clean two datasets and then investigate any correlation between the mean population of each country in the dataset 
												and the mean per capita GDP. It also asked students to generate a plot and briefly interpret it, as well as evaluate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. 
												Below is one of the plots created while undergoing this task. 
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Correlation Image.png" alt="" /></span>
												<br>
												<u>Task B: Regression</u>
												<br> 
												<br> 
												This task asked students to perform linear regression where the independent variable is the mean population of each country (from 2001 to 2021) 
												and dependent variable is mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021). Below is the plot created from undergoing that task.

										<h3>Jaccard Coefficient Calculations</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Calculate the Jaccard Coefficient Calculations in a given table.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
														<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												I was given the following table and told to calculate the Jaccard Coefficient for the following pairs: "Jack and Mary", "Jack and Jim", and "Mary and Jim". 
												To properly calculate the Jaccard coefficient, first I discarded the gender column and transformed the rest of the table into binaries. 
												<div class="row">
													<div class="column">
													  <img src="images/Jaccard 1.png" style="width:100%">
													</div>
													<div class="column">
													  <img src="images/Jaccard 2.png" style="width:100%">
													</div>
												</div> 
												After converting the table into binaries, we calculate the intersection between each pair. For example, Jack and Mary both have Fever and Test, so they have an intersection of 2. 
												Jack and Jim have an intersection of 2 as well, and so does Mary and Jim. 
												We also need to find out the union between the pairs. According to the binary table, Jack and Mary have 5 total attributes. Jack and Jim have 4, and Mary and Jim have 6. 
												The Jaccard coefficients are as follows: Jack and Mary = 2/5 = 0.4, Jack and Jim = 2/4 = 0.5, Mary and Jim = 2/6 ≈ 0.333.

										<h3>K-Means Clustering Tutorial</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Complete one of three tasks to develop an understanding of how to use K-Means Clustering.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
													<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												There are three tasks that students could choose from for this tutorial. I chose Task A, which had students perform K-Means clustering using 
												the Iris dataset. There were a few steps that had to be done first, which included removing several columns. While the value of K can be varied, this 
												task had students use K = 3. After creating the clusters, the task was to then check how similar the three clusters are as compared to the labels 
												of species – setosa, versicolour, and verginica. As can be seen in the confusion matrix below, cluster 2 consists mostly of the species virginica with some versicolour, 
												cluster 0 consists mostly of the species versicolour with some virginica, and cluster 1 consists entirely of setosa.

										<h3>Gradient Cost Function</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Run a Jupyter notebook and change the iteration number and learning_rate and observe how cost decreases.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The original Gradient Cost Function had an iteration number of 100 and a learning_rate of 0.08. 
												When running the notebook without any changes, the cost started at 89.0 at iteration 0, and ended up at cost 0.00412 at iteration 99. 
												Changing the iteration number to be smaller resulted in no real interesting changes, as we already had records of all the iterations up to 99. 
												However, changing the learning_rate to 0.16, double what it originally was, resulted in extremely high costs, with iteration 99 having a cost of 1.1171143851204643e+90!

										<h3>CNN Model Activity</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Read the Wall (2019) article and record your thoughts on the ethical and social implications of this CNN technology.
												In addition, run a CNN model and review different sections of the algorithm. Change the input image for prediction by changing the value of this variable - plt.imshow(x_test[16] - from 16 to value of your choice (1-15) and see whether the model predicts correctly.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The Wall (2019) article, which can be found
												<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48842750" target="_blank"> "here"</a>, 
												discusses the various uses of Facial Recognition (FR) technology, and the ethics behind its use. The datasets that FR technology is trained on 
												are predominantly white, leaving minority individuals at the risk of being misidentified, wrongly persecuted, and otherwise harmed or discriminated against. 
												While the technology may have a place in the future, I personally believe that it should not be used until the risk of wrongly harming an innocent is as close to 
												zero as it can possibly get. 
												<br> 
												<br> 
												The other part of this task has use run a CNN model and change the input image. I decided to change the input image to 5, as it is my lucky number. The CNN accurately predicted my image, which was

										<h3>Model Performance Measurement</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Run the model_Performance_Measurement.ipnyb file and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												After running the notebook, I changed various parameters to observe their impact on AUC and R2 error. One example of this is experimenting with different kernels for the SVM classifier, as seen below. 
												Where ROC = 0.74, I changed the kernel from Linear (which had a ROC = 0.79) to rbf.
