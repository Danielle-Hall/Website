										<h3>Gradient Cost Function</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Run a Jupyter notebook and change the iteration number and learning_rate and observe how cost decreases.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The original Gradient Cost Function had an iteration number of 100 and a learning_rate of 0.08. 
												When running the notebook without any changes, the cost started at 89.0 at iteration 0, and ended up at cost 0.00412 at iteration 99. 
												Changing the iteration number to be smaller resulted in no real interesting changes, as we already had records of all the iterations up to 99. 
												However, changing the learning_rate to 0.16, double what it originally was, resulted in extremely high costs, with iteration 99 having a cost of 1.1171143851204643e+90!

										<h3>CNN Model Activity</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Read the Wall (2019) article and record your thoughts on the ethical and social implications of this CNN technology.
												In addition, run a CNN model and review different sections of the algorithm. Change the input image for prediction by changing the value of this variable - plt.imshow(x_test[16] - from 16 to value of your choice (1-15) and see whether the model predicts correctly.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The Wall (2019) article, which can be found
												<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48842750" target="_blank"> "here"</a>, 
												discusses the various uses of Facial Recognition (FR) technology, and the ethics behind its use. The datasets that FR technology is trained on 
												are predominantly white, leaving minority individuals at the risk of being misidentified, wrongly persecuted, and otherwise harmed or discriminated against. 
												While the technology may have a place in the future, I personally believe that it should not be used until the risk of wrongly harming an innocent is as close to 
												zero as it can possibly get. 
												<br> 
												<br> 
												The other part of this task has use run a CNN model and change the input image. I decided to change the input image to 5, as it is my lucky number. The CNN accurately predicted my image, which was

										<h3>Model Performance Measurement</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Run the model_Performance_Measurement.ipnyb file and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												After running the notebook, I changed various parameters to observe their impact on AUC and R2 error. One example of this is experimenting with different kernels for the SVM classifier, as seen below. 
												Where ROC = 0.74, I changed the kernel from Linear (which had a ROC = 0.79) to rbf.
