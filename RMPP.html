										<h3>Literature Review</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Critically evaluate existing literature, research design and methodology for a chosen topic and produce a literature review on this topic.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.</li>
													<li>Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												For the topic of this literature review, I chose the topic: 
												<i>"What is the gender pay gap in the technology sector in the country of your choice?"</i> 
												from a list of topics given to all students. After choosing this question, I did some research on the topic, specifically in its 
												application to the country I live in, which is Norway. While doing research, I followed a 
												<a href="Assignments/Unit 2 - Writing a Literature Review 2024.pdf" target="_blank"> "Guidance Document"</a> 
												given to us in Unit 2 of this module, which helped me develop which direction to research in. After doing this, I developed the following research question: 
												<i>"What are the key factors contributing to the gender pay gap in Norway’s technology sector, and how can an in-depth understanding of these factors help inform strategies to mitigate the pay disparity between genders?"</i>
												Unfortunately, after narrowing down my question, I realized that there is not much literature to be found on this topic within Norway. While the gender pay gap exists, there is little research focusing specifically 
												on the gender pay gap within the technology sector within Norway. Despite this, I very much wanted to discuss this topic, so I extrapolated various literature pieces from other European countries that focused on the technology gender pay gap,
												 as well as general trends when it comes to the gender pay gap within Norway and applied them to the topic. After finding the research, I then wrote my 
												<a href="Assignments/Literature Review.pdf" target="_blank"> "Literature Review"</a>.

										<h3>Research Proposal Presentation</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Critically evaluate existing literature, research design and methodology for a chosen topic and then design a research proposal for that topic and present the proposal using PowerPoint.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.</li>
													<li>Produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen topic.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												For my research proposal, I already knew early on that I did not want to cover the same topic as my Literature Review. Instead, I considered attempting to write a research proposal 
												for the topic I wanted to cover for my Computing Project. While I had a general idea that I wanted to focus on how we can predict early onset mental illness using machine learning, 
												I was unsure where to go from there. Focusing on the guideline document in Unit 2 for the literature review, as well as the questions given to the students during Unit 3, helped me narrow down what I wanted to focus on. These questions are as follows: 
												<ul> 
												<li>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</li>
												<li>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</li>
												<li>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</li>
												</ul>
												After further consideration, I developed the following topic: 
												<i>Gender-Specific Predictive Modeling for Early Detection of Mental Health Issues
												</i> 
												and from this topic, I developed the following research question:
												<i>“Can gender-specific predictive models increase the accuracy of predicting the onset of mental illness?”
												</i>. 
												It is a bit inspired by my literature review, which covered gender differences in pay, however this focuses more on how we can create machine learning models that more accurately determine the onset of mental illness 
												by focusing on gender specific factors. After developing the direction of my research and following the guiding questions, I developed my 
												<a href="Assignments/Research Proposal.pptx" target="_blank"> "Research Proposal Presentation"</a>, with a 
												<a href="Assignments/Presentation Transcript.pdf" target="_blank"> "Transcript"</a>.
