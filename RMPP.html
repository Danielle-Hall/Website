											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>

												<u>Task A: Correlation</u>
												<br> 
												<br> 
												This task asked students to clean two datasets and then investigate any correlation between the mean population of each country in the dataset 
												and the mean per capita GDP. It also asked students to generate a plot and briefly interpret it, as well as evaluate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. 
												Below is one of the plots created while undergoing this task. 
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Correlation Image.png" alt="" /></span>
												<br>
												<u>Task B: Regression</u>
												<br> 
												<br> 
												This task asked students to perform linear regression where the independent variable is the mean population of each country (from 2001 to 2021) 
												and dependent variable is mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021). Below is the plot created from undergoing that task.

										<h3>Jaccard Coefficient Calculations</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Calculate the Jaccard Coefficient Calculations in a given table.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
														<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												I was given the following table and told to calculate the Jaccard Coefficient for the following pairs: "Jack and Mary", "Jack and Jim", and "Mary and Jim". 
												To properly calculate the Jaccard coefficient, first I discarded the gender column and transformed the rest of the table into binaries. 
												<div class="row">
													<div class="column">
													  <img src="images/Jaccard 1.png" style="width:100%">
													</div>
													<div class="column">
													  <img src="images/Jaccard 2.png" style="width:100%">
													</div>
												</div> 
												After converting the table into binaries, we calculate the intersection between each pair. For example, Jack and Mary both have Fever and Test, so they have an intersection of 2. 
												Jack and Jim have an intersection of 2 as well, and so does Mary and Jim. 
												We also need to find out the union between the pairs. According to the binary table, Jack and Mary have 5 total attributes. Jack and Jim have 4, and Mary and Jim have 6. 
												The Jaccard coefficients are as follows: Jack and Mary = 2/5 = 0.4, Jack and Jim = 2/4 = 0.5, Mary and Jim = 2/6 ≈ 0.333.

										<h3>K-Means Clustering Tutorial</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Complete one of three tasks to develop an understanding of how to use K-Means Clustering.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
													<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												There are three tasks that students could choose from for this tutorial. I chose Task A, which had students perform K-Means clustering using 
												the Iris dataset. There were a few steps that had to be done first, which included removing several columns. While the value of K can be varied, this 
												task had students use K = 3. After creating the clusters, the task was to then check how similar the three clusters are as compared to the labels 
												of species – setosa, versicolour, and verginica. As can be seen in the confusion matrix below, cluster 2 consists mostly of the species virginica with some versicolour, 
												cluster 0 consists mostly of the species versicolour with some virginica, and cluster 1 consists entirely of setosa.

										<h3>Gradient Cost Function</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Run a Jupyter notebook and change the iteration number and learning_rate and observe how cost decreases.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The original Gradient Cost Function had an iteration number of 100 and a learning_rate of 0.08. 
												When running the notebook without any changes, the cost started at 89.0 at iteration 0, and ended up at cost 0.00412 at iteration 99. 
												Changing the iteration number to be smaller resulted in no real interesting changes, as we already had records of all the iterations up to 99. 
												However, changing the learning_rate to 0.16, double what it originally was, resulted in extremely high costs, with iteration 99 having a cost of 1.1171143851204643e+90!

										<h3>CNN Model Activity</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Read the Wall (2019) article and record your thoughts on the ethical and social implications of this CNN technology.
												In addition, run a CNN model and review different sections of the algorithm. Change the input image for prediction by changing the value of this variable - plt.imshow(x_test[16] - from 16 to value of your choice (1-15) and see whether the model predicts correctly.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
													<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The Wall (2019) article, which can be found
												<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48842750" target="_blank"> "here"</a>, 
												discusses the various uses of Facial Recognition (FR) technology, and the ethics behind its use. The datasets that FR technology is trained on 
												are predominantly white, leaving minority individuals at the risk of being misidentified, wrongly persecuted, and otherwise harmed or discriminated against. 
												While the technology may have a place in the future, I personally believe that it should not be used until the risk of wrongly harming an innocent is as close to 
												zero as it can possibly get. 
												<br> 
												<br> 
												The other part of this task has use run a CNN model and change the input image. I decided to change the input image to 5, as it is my lucky number. The CNN accurately predicted my image, which was

										<h3>Model Performance Measurement</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Run the model_Performance_Measurement.ipnyb file and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												After running the notebook, I changed various parameters to observe their impact on AUC and R2 error. One example of this is experimenting with different kernels for the SVM classifier, as seen below. 
												Where ROC = 0.74, I changed the kernel from Linear (which had a ROC = 0.79) to rbf.
