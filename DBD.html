									<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<ul>
											<li>Introduce and review various concepts of big data, technologies, and data management to enable you identify and manage challenges associated with security risks and limitations.</li>
											<li>Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies and tools in problem solving.</li>
											<li>Explore different data types and formats. Evaluate various data storage formats ranging from structured, quasi structured, semi structured, and unstructured formats. We explore the various memory and storage requirements.</li>
											<li>Critically examine various data collection methods and sources. Review fact finding methods to determine the integrity, reliability and readiness of data extracted and presented for pre-processing, cleaning, and usage.</li>
											<li>Examine data exploration methods and analyse data for presentation in an organisation. Critically evaluate data readability, readiness, and longevity within the data Pipeline. Examine cloud services, API (Application Programming Interfaces) and how this enables data interoperability and connectivity.</li>
											<li>Examine and analyse the ideas and theoretical concepts underlying DBMS (Database Management Systems) Database Design and Modelling.</li>
											<li>Explore the future of use of data and deciphering by examining some fundamental ideas and concepts of machine learning and how these concepts are applied in various methods in handling big data.</li>
										</ul>

											<h3>Development Team Project: Project Report</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Posing as a team of IT Software Consultants and Developers, design a single logical database for a hypothetical organization.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques (involving preparing, cleaning, exploring, creating, optimising and evaluating big data) to solve them.</li>
													<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>This assignment involved several phases of collaboration. After some brainstorming and discussion about our individual strengths, the team decided that creating a relational database for an organization that needed their HR hiring process optimized would be best. When considering the design, first we visualized the <i>flow of the data</i>
												<span class="image left"><img src="images/DBD Project Report Visual Flow.png" alt="" /></span>. 
												<span class="image right"><img src="images/DBD Project Report database design.png" alt="" /></span> After a couple more rough drafts, we landed on what seemed to be a <i>concrete database design</i>. After that, we collectively wrote the finalized 
												<a href="Assignments/DBD Project Report.pdf" target="_blank"> "project report"</a> that communicated our design and build to the hypothetical organization.

											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Demonstrate a critical awareness of roles and responsibilities (legal, ethical, social, and professional) of a Data Science professional.</li>
													<li>Critically analyse architecture, design, development methodology, querying and the lifecycle of managing large-scale datasets.</li>

											<h3>Data Analytics Report</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Create a Data Analytics Report for Transport For Wales</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Critically analyse architecture, design, development methodology, querying and the lifecycle of managing large-scale datasets.</li>
													<li>Distinguish between and critically reflect on the solutions of various data analytics approaches which support business decision making process.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>Assignment Details: Transport for Wales has conducted a detailed survey to understand its citizenâ€™s view on the public transport system. 
												As a data scientist, the department has awarded you a data analysis contract.  The information you supply will facilitate the executives 
												taking necessary measures to improve the transportation systems in the country. Your first task is to write an initial 
												<a href="Assignments/Data Analytics Report.pdf" target="_blank"> "Data Analytics Report"</a> which will cover your plans for data processing and evaluation.

											<h3>Data Analytics Implementation</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Undertake the analysis according to the suggested design in your Data Analytics Report.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Distinguish between and critically reflect on the solutions of various data analytics approaches which support business decision making process.</li>
													<li>Apply and evaluate critically the various methods, tools, technologies and success factors applied to a data science project in order to develop an effective plan and delivery of solutions to a business problem.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>This assignment uses charts and graphs created with Python along with a written 
												<a href="Assignments/Data Analytics Implementation.pdf" target="_blank"> "Implementation document"</a> that details the data analysis methods that were undertaken.
