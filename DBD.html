									<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<ul>
											<li>Introduce and review various concepts of big data, technologies, and data management to enable you identify and manage challenges associated with security risks and limitations.</li>
											<li>Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies and tools in problem solving.</li>
											<li>Explore different data types and formats. Evaluate various data storage formats ranging from structured, quasi structured, semi structured, and unstructured formats. We explore the various memory and storage requirements.</li>
											<li>Critically examine various data collection methods and sources. Review fact finding methods to determine the integrity, reliability and readiness of data extracted and presented for pre-processing, cleaning, and usage.</li>
											<li>Examine data exploration methods and analyse data for presentation in an organisation. Critically evaluate data readability, readiness, and longevity within the data Pipeline. Examine cloud services, API (Application Programming Interfaces) and how this enables data interoperability and connectivity.</li>
											<li>Examine and analyse the ideas and theoretical concepts underlying DBMS (Database Management Systems) Database Design and Modelling.</li>
											<li>Explore the future of use of data and deciphering by examining some fundamental ideas and concepts of machine learning and how these concepts are applied in various methods in handling big data.</li>

											<h3>Development Team Project: Project Report</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Posing as a team of IT Software Consultants and Developers, design a single logical database for a hypothetical organization.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques (involving preparing, cleaning, exploring, creating, optimising and evaluating big data) to solve them.</li>
													<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>This assignment involved several phases of collaboration. After some brainstorming and discussion about our individual strengths, the team decided that creating a nal nal database for an organization that needed their HR hiring process optimized would be best.
												When considering the design, first we visualized the <i>flow of the data</i>. 
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/DBD Project Report Visual Flow.png" alt="" /></span>
												This involved considering what data the organization might want in their new HR database, what categories the data would need to be divided into, and how the data would be input into and move around within the database.
												After a couple more rough drafts, we landed on what seemed to be a <i>concrete database design</i>. 
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/DBD Project Report database design.png" alt="" /></span>
												After that, we collectively wrote the finalized 
												<a href="Assignments/DBD Project Report.pdf" target="_blank"> "project report"</a> that communicated our design and build to the hypothetical organization.

											<h3>Development Individual Project: Executive Summary</h3>
											<h4><i>Objective: Create an executive summary of the completed design and build of the logical database based on the project report sumbitted by your team.</i></h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Design, develop and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments using relevant programming paradigms.</li>
													<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>This assignment involved building off of the previous project report and finalizing the database design and build. This assignment also called for a more critical analysis of the database, with reference to the literature 
												on the pros and cons of our database design and build. In the project report assignment, the team had originally decided to create a relational database, as this is one of the most commonly used databases within HR (Moura, 2021). 
												However, when I did further research I discovered that while relational databases are used, they might not be the best option in the future. I go more in depth on this in section 4.2 of the 
												<a href="Assignments/Executive Summary.pdf" target="_blank"> "executive summary"</a>, and I personally think it was the most fun and interesting part of the report to write. Perhaps relational databases are 
												a thing of the past, and we will all move towards NoSQL or graph databases in order to manage the large amount of data transactions that occur in the current "Big Data Era" (Bara et al., 2015).
